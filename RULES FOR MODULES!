# These are the build constraints for making modules.

Each modules size is
13 Blocks long.
No width limit
5 blocks high.
Note, the length does not include the face block.
Module Face Dimensions.
No width limit
5 blocks high

MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR COMMAND BLOCKS USE ~ ~ ~ FOR COORDINATES!!!
Reason Why:
We want the mainframe of these panels to be easy to copy and paste.

Blocks that are going to be redstone source blocks, that arent there
must be set to glass. Exceptions for blocks that need to pass a
redstone signal.
